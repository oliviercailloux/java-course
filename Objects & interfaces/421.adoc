You must implement the interface `Game421`. You may name the class as you like. You do not have to implement `DiceRoller`. You may not change the `Game421` or `DiceRoller` interfaces.

A class `RandomDiceRoller` is provided that implements `DiceRoller` to help you test your implementation of `Game421`, if you want. You may define more constructs if you like (test classes, helper classes, …) and you may change (or duplicate…) the existing `RandomDiceRoller` class if you so desire.
