= Letâ€™s multiply

This class permits to store two operands, and compute the result of multiplying them. Thus, after calling `setFirstOperand(3)` and `setSecondOperand(4)`, `multiply()` should return 12.

== General mode
By default, the class is in general mode.
In general mode, the operands and the result of multiplication can be any value (positive, negative or zero).

== Positive mode
The class can be switched to positive mode.
In positive mode, the operands can be set only to strictly positive values and the result of multiplication must be strictly positive.

== Positive result mode
The class can be switched to positive result mode.
In positive result mode, the operands can be set to any value and the result of multiplication must be strictly positive.

== Requirements
Implement the method `setPositiveMode` and `setPositiveResultMode` that switches the class to the corresponding mode and `setGeneralMode` that switches the class back to general mode.
Implement the methods `setFirstOperand`, `setSecondOperand` and `multiply` that react according to the current mode. 
Throw exceptions appropriately.

== Hints

One way to implement the requirements is to store the operands and the mode in variables (but you are free to choose another way).

Note that the specifications here are incomplete. You may choose any reasonable way to implement the requirements, as long as you satisfy all of them.

If you implement only the general mode, you will get 30% of the points.
