= Java EE
:sectanchors:

This folder documents Java EE. This was up-to-date, mostly, as of beginning of 2019. I have not updated it for the newer https://jakarta.ee/[Jakarta EE], so watch out for relevant differences!

== Useful tools
* https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/[Eclipse IDE] “for Java EE Developers”
* Download and install (deflate) https://wildfly.org/downloads/[WildFly] (14.0.1.Final or more recent, Java EE Full & Web Distribution)
* https://tools.jboss.org/downloads/jbosstools/2018-09/4.9.0.Final.html[JBoss Tools], a plug-in for easy deployment to Wildfly. Install only JBoss AS, WildFly & EAP Server Tools. (Rationale: I have had stability issues in Eclipse after installing the whole of JBoss Tools.) Or https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/blob/main/Dev%20tools/Automated%20Eclipse%20install.adoc[automate] it.

== VM (beta)
// https://universitedauphine-my.sharepoint.com/personal/olivier_cailloux_lamsade_dauphine_fr/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?docid=03887190377294e79a8a63c8f063ffe9b&authkey=AdV4WjBgnfjLa2IRffbav5s&e=10400376c63043138b324257b2c8c6a6[Here] is a Virtual Machine (VM) file that contains (almost) all the tools above. It features https://www.debian.org/doc/user-manuals[Debian] stretch (9.2), a GNU/Linux system. The VM file is in a standard format (OVA). You can import it in https://www.virtualbox.org/[Virtual Box] for example. Tell me if you are interested, I will then update it.

The file is in beta version, please report any issues https://github.com/oliviercailloux/Deb-9-VM[here].

Note that you will get (much?) better performance by installing the tools directly on your machine rather than using them through a VM.
