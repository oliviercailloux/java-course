= Eclipse

For this course you will need the 2020-12 version of the https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/[Eclipse IDE] “for Java Developers”.

== Basics
To exploit the power of Eclipse, at the very minimum, you must understand the notion of perspectives and views, and know how to easily navigate within resources.

In the Workbench User Guide, https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/gettingStarted/qs-02a.htm[Basic tutorial], follow the first few sections of the tutorial: `The Workbench`, `Editors and views`, `A simple project`, `Closing an editor` and `Navigating resources`; then read `Rearranging views and editors`.

== Basic exercices

* In the `Resource` perspective, open the `Error Log` view
* Switch to the `Java` perspective; open the `Javadoc` and the `Problems` views
* Clone the the https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-money[Joda-Money] repository and import it into Eclipse using `File` / `Open Projects from File System`. Go directly to the class `Money` using a means you just learned, and, using the `Outline` view, go to the method `convertedTo`. Focus on the text `withCurrencyScale`, in the method implementation. Make sure your `Javadoc` view shows the documentation of that method.

== Eclipse & Java
To code efficiently in Java within Eclipse:

* Use Outline view
* Use Problems view
* Use Javadoc view
* Use content completion with CTRL+Space
* Use Organize imports (from an editor, select `Source` / `Organize Imports`)
* Use automatic code formatting (from an editor, select `Source` / `Format`)

Check this very clear https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Eclipse/article.html[tutorial from vogella] for the basics of using Eclipse with Java, including explanations about the points here above. Read up to section 16 included as well as sections 21 and 22.

== Configuration
Configure Eclipse to show more errors and warnings in order to help spot mistakes and code smells early (and add a “GoogleStyle + block + braced” formatter style).

* From Eclipse, import this https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/master/Dev%20tools/Eclipse-prefs.epf[epf] (Eclipse Preference File) (save it on your computer first), with `File` / `Import…` / `General` / `Preferences`.
** You can look at the text in the file to see what this changes to your Eclipse configuration.
* Check in `Windows` / `Preferences` whether the changes were applied. For example, check in `Java` / `Code Style` / `Code Templates` that the `Catch block body` contains `throw new IllegalStateException(e);`.
* Check in your project properties, `Java Compiler` / `Errors/Warnings` that the project uses your global Eclipse compiler settings.
* Clean and recompile your project to see the effect.
* Check that the instruction `ArrayList<String> l = new ArrayList<String>();` raises a warning (“Redundant specification of type arguments <String>”).

====
As an exception to strict checking, I authorize boxing and unboxing without warnings. This is because first, the warning has drawbacks and second, it is not very effective. First, this warning sometimes encourage writing more obscure code, for example `myMap.put(Integer.valueOf(myInt), myValue)` instead of `myMap.put(myInt, myValue)`. (And stuffing your code with `@SuppressWarnings("boxing")` instructions is equally inelegant.) Second, this warning only helps avoiding possible null pointer exceptions (when unboxing), and this anyway is a problem that happens when dealing with objects. It feels unjustified to spend so much energy on this risk specifically when dealing with numeric types.

== Start project
To start a Java project, use `File` / `New` / `Java Project`, give it a name, then in the next page, uncheck `Create module-info.java file`. If you forgot to uncheck this, you should delete that file (we use the simpler class path mechanism in this course, see https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/blob/master/Execution/README.adoc#modules[here] for references about the module path).
