= Libs

My recommendations concerning various libraries.

* Google https://github.com/google/guava[Guava]: “new collection types (such as multimap and multiset), immutable collections, a graph library, functional types, an in-memory cache, and APIs/utilities for concurrency, I/O, hashing, primitives, reflection, string processing, and much more”. You should definitely use their preconditions helpers. Then check whatever else you might have a use for.
* Parce https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values[CSV] files: https://super-csv.github.io/super-csv/index.html[SuperCSV]; https://github.com/uniVocity/univocity-parsers[uniVocity] (more recent, looks nice, but I haven’t tried it); more https://www.baeldung.com/java-csv[references]
* Parse command line arguments: I have used Apache http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-cli/[Commons CLI], but I’d encourage you to check out https://jcommander.org/[JCommander], or https://java.libhunt.com/compare-jcommander-vs-jopt-simple[perhaps] http://jopt-simple.github.io/jopt-simple/[JOpt Simple].
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar[iCalendar] (ical, ics) files: according to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33901/best-icalendar-library-for-java[SO], https://github.com/mangstadt/biweekly[biweekly] is better than https://github.com/ical4j/ical4j[iCal4j]. I found that iCal4j has very scarce http://ical4j.sourceforge.net/introduction.html[documentation]. A minor inconvenience of both is that they use old date-time java objects rather than the new https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/[java.time] API.
* XML parsing: see https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/blob/main/DOM.adoc[DOM]
* Graphs: Guava (see above) has nice Graph structures, but few algorithms. 
** JGraphT provides https://jgrapht.org/javadoc/org/jgrapht/graph/guava/package-summary.html[adapters] to Guava and is very active. 
** JUNG https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained#why-should-i-use-it-instead-of-something-else[inspired] the structures of Guava; its most recent version is version 2.1.1, released 7 September 2016; https://github.com/jrtom/jung/issues/236#issuecomment-530532746[“it's active, it's just proceeding very slowly”]; this https://github.com/jrtom/jung/issues/222[issue] discusses its link to Guava. 
** https://graphstream-project.org/[GraphStream] is active and seems serious (has a research team behind it) but I don’t like its core api: a node is a heavy interface that your own nodes have to extend. No apparent link to Guava.
** https://github.com/apache/commons-graph/[Apache commons graph] has gone https://markmail.org/search/?q=graph%20list%3Aorg.apache.commons.users%2F#query:graph%20list%3Aorg.apache.commons.users%2F+page:1+mid:mmbhrpnpqyspml3s+state:results[unmaintained] for a long time but was reactivated and committed to during https://github.com/apache/commons-graph/commits/master[June to Aug. 2020] (Related discussions on the ML: https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@commons.apache.org/msg68827.html[still on sandbox ?], https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@commons.apache.org/msg68844.html[moving to git], https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@commons.apache.org/msg68914.html[Travis CI configuration], https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@commons.apache.org/msg68955.html[Build fails (unit tests)])
** Baeldung https://www.baeldung.com/java-graphs#4-sourceforge-jung[mentions] “more powerful frameworks based on graphs, such as Apache Giraph, currently used at Facebook to analyze the graph formed by their users, and Apache TinkerPop, commonly used on top of graph databases”, which I didn’t check.
** https://github.com/lhogie/grph[grph] is https://groups.google.com/d/msg/grph-high-performance-graphs-for-java/jHbFY5tVeTA/hIJofDLeCwAJ[not active] any more
** https://github.com/monora/jgraphl[jgraphl] is https://github.com/monora/jgraphl/commits/master[almost] inactive
* Personaly, I refrain from using Vavr, because it uses https://www.javadoc.io/static/io.vavr/vavr/0.10.3/io/vavr/control/Try.html#get--[sneaky throws] (this position is https://javatechnicalwealth.com/blog/java-exception-and-lambda-to-go-sneaky-or-not-part-2/[debated]). Same for https://github.com/zalando/faux-pas#throwing-functional-interfaces[Faux Pas], https://noexception.machinezoo.com/javadoc/com/machinezoo/noexception/Exceptions.html#sneak--[NoException] and _fge_’s https://github.com/fge/throwing-lambdas/wiki/How-it-works#throwing-and-chainer[throwing-lambdas].
