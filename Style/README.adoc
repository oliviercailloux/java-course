= Style

Various suggestions about adopting a good coding style in Java.

See: https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/blob/master/Style/Code.adoc[Formatting and commenting code], https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/blob/master/Style/Null.adoc[Avoid nulls], and read the suggestion below about static factory methods.

== Favor static factory methods
Static factory methods are static methods that play the role of constructors (hence the name factory) from the point of view of the user of your class.
See https://www.baeldung.com/java-constructors-vs-static-factory-methods[here] for the reasons for favoring static factory methods over constructors in your public interface.
Examples: `String.valueOf(true);`, `Integer.valueOf(3);`, `ImmutableList.of();`, `String.link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#format(java.lang.String,java.lang.Object.%2E.)[format]("Person name: %s, id: %d", name, id);`.
Use the following idiom (or an appropriate variant).

[source,java]
----
public class MyClass {
	public static MyClass given(int someParameter) {
		return new MyClass(someParameter);
	}
	
	private MyClass(int someParameter) {
		/** basic initializationâ€¦ */
	}
}

=== Exercice
Assuming you have implemented a class `Pair` as requested https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/blob/master/Objects%20%26%20interfaces/README.adoc#exercice-generic-pair[here].

Create two static factory methods for your class `Pair`. One that creates a pair holding twice the same element, and one that creates a pair with elements that are guaranteed to be different.

== Design a simple, unique constructor
A class should have a unique private constructor that should be guaranteed to succeed and return reasonably quickly. Thus, it should not throw exceptions and should not engage in lengthy computations, spawn new threads, or anything fancy of that sort. If your class should do something risky or fancy, do it in another method than its constructor, and call that method (from the static factory method, possibly). This separates concerns clearly, and permits to decompose object creation and object use.
