== Prerequisites
* You know algorithmics: you know how to design algorithms to solve problems, using data structures, if required, such as lists or stacks.
* You can implement such algorithms in C++, Python or some similar language
* You can use at least one of the three major operating systems (Windows, a Linux variant or Mac OS) to compile and run a program in at least one language, and are generally at ease with that OS: you know how to edit files and move them around, install and use basic programs, …
* You are able to understand texts in English relating to computer science

[[S13]]
== S13: 23 May
* Update on notation. Grades: <git-modify-final, git-branching-final, multiply-final, mvni-final, mvni-final, last, last>. OWA with weights 0.1, 0.1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2 except that weights of _L = {git-modify-final, git-branching-final, multiply-final}_ are maximum 0.7 and weight 2 goes to highest of _{mvni-final, mvni-final, last, last}_. Thus: weight 2 to _max{mvni-final, last}_, order remaining grades _g1_ to _g6_ (_g1_ the best one), each of _g1_, _g2_, _g3_ and _g4_ receive weight 1 or 0.7 if they are in _L_, weight 0.1 to _g5_ and _g6_.
