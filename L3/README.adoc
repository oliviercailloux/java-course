== Prerequisites
You know algorithmics: you know how to design algorithms to solve problems, using data structures, if required, such as lists or stacks. 
You can use at least one of the three major operating systems (Windows, a Linux variant or Mac OS) to compile and run a program in at least one language, and are generally at ease with that OS: you know how to edit files and move them around, install and use basic programs, …

== Abbreviations

* [I]: Important
* [O]: Optional (do it if you are specifically interested in the related aspect)
* ESx.y (or ESx.y.z): designates section x.y (or x.y.z) in Eck’s https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/[book] (in chapter x)
* EQx: quiz chapter x
* EQx.y: question number y in Eck’s book, from quiz chapter x
* EEx.y: exercice number y in Eck’s book, from exercices chapter x
* Ranges are always given with ends included (EQ1.3 to 1.9 means 3 and 9 included)
* Markers apply to the whole line. Example: "4.3 intro to 4.3.2, 4.6.1 [I]" means that everything in between 4.3 and 4.3.2 plus 4.6.1 are important.

=== S7 (3 Mar)

* Graded exercice about: Eclipse, Contract, Objects, Interfaces, Exceptions. Accept https://classroom.github.com/a/M-4KNbQC[this assignment] to create your remote repository for this exercice. Clone my https://github.com/oliviercailloux/coffee/[Coffee] repository. Connect your local resulting repository to your remote repository for this exercice (instead of, or in supplement to, my Coffee repository). Implement the classes `DripCoffeeMaker` and `MyEspressoMachine`, making sure they satisfy their contracts. Do _not_ _change_ any provided code, you may only _add_ new code (thus, leave the package declarations untouched). Push your work frequently to your remote repository for this exercice, making sure that it compiles. You have 45 minutes: the deadline is at 14:31.
** As usual, you must configure Eclipse as expected in this course; and make sure your git `user.name` equals your GitHub username.
** If the code does not compile, the grade is zero.

[[S9]]
=== S9 (17 Mar)

* Graded exercice, _at Dauphine_: mainly about the contents of S7 and S8. As usual, you will have to accept an assignment to create your own remote repository; clone one of my repositories; connect your local repository to your own remote repository; and push your commits there. Make sure you can do this easily. *This test will count for three of the previous tests.*

* Files and flows: https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/blob/master/Flows.adoc#path-operations[Path operations] and providers.
* Comparator and sorting, (Comparable), Maps

* *Exercices*:
** Define an interface `EasyMap` with two methods: a method that puts a pair of key (`String`, the last name of a person, here supposed to be unique) and value (`Person`, having a first name and a last name) into a map, and a method that returns an `Optional` containing the value corresponding to the given key (parameter of the method) or that returns an empty `Optional` if there is no such value. Implement this interface in a class `EasyMapImpl`. Provide a static factory method in the interface `EasyMap` (it declares that it returns an `EasyMap`, and does it by instanciating your `EasyMapImpl`). Minimize the number of lines of code (but not at the price of readability). Note that this exercice implements a part of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forwarding_(object-oriented_programming)[forwarding] pattern.
** Define `MyComparator`, a class that implements a comparator over `Person`: it considers a person as “smaller” (or “coming before”) another person according to the dictionary ordering of their last name. Add a third method to `EasyMap`, that returns a list of values ordered by that comparator.
// implement a hashmap with a list of lists
** *TODO home* https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c10/exercises.html[EE10.3] (you may use `List` implementations, but not `Map`, of course)
// TreeMap<String, TreeSet<Integer>>  concordance
** https://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c10/exercises.html[EE10.6]
* No https://mycore.core-cloud.net/index.php/s/jDdn1OcEfjjj8NU[plagiarism], but reuse! (Link to audio track from https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Jeu_des_dictionnaires[Le Jeu des Dictionnaires], included with permission from geluck.com.)

* Graded test: string-files. About `Set`, `List`, files, flows, paths, providers, and the methods `https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html[Files]#copy`, `createFile`, `delete`, `exists`, `isDirectory`, `readAllLines`, `readString`, `write`, `writeString`. Some (incomplete) unit tests are already provided, to help you test your implementation (look under `src/test/`). You have 30 minutes. Hint: use up to 10 minutes to make sure you understand the contract, including by reading the unit tests. Hint 2: implement the methods in the order they are defined in the interface.
* Override https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/blob/master/Best%20practices/Local%20design.adoc#the-equalsobject-method[`equals`] and `hashcode`
** Exercice: override `equals` on a class `Sock` that contains `color` and `size` fields. Test using a unit test that two socks are equal exactly when they should. Override `hashCode`. Test using a unit test that two equal socks have the same hashCode. Explain how you guarantee (by a reasoning, not by code) that this is true in general for your `Sock` class (not only in the case under test)? In another unit test, create three sock instances `a`, `b`, `c`, two being (semantically) equal, so that `a.equals(b)` and `!a.equals(c)`. Put `a` and `c` in a `LinkedHashSet`. Imagine that `LinkedHashSet` uses an array of size 10 and explain how Java could have decided in which compartment to put `a` and `c`. Are they possibly / necessarily in the same compartment? Check that `contains(a)`, `contains(b)`, `contains(c)` (on the set) returns `true`. Explain why and how it returns `true` in the case of `b`.

* Graded test: chess. About generics, `Set`, `List`, `Map`, and other classes and interfaces related to the collections in Java (see S6 to S9); as well as the class `Optional` (see https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/blob/master/Best%20practices/Null.adoc[BP null]). You will have 90 minutes. (You can reuse the Coffee exercice in order to practice to start quickly.) Please have a look at the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)[algebraic notation] and at the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_piece[chess pieces] if you know nothing about chess. (You do not have to know the rules of the game.) _Hint_: make sure the first method is implemented correctly.
* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html[Method references]
** *Exercice* Define a class `Person` with a name and a height. Define a class `IsNameAToG` which implements `Predicate<Person>` and whose `test` method returns `true` iff the name of the person, upper cased, starts with a letter between `A` and `G`. In a unit test, define a set of persons, and use `stream()` on the set, then `filter` and `count` on the resulting stream, to count the number of persons in your set whose name match the predicate. In the unit test, make sure you have a line looking like `Predicate<Person> myPredicate = …`.
** Define a class `IsGreaterThan` which implements `Predicate<Person>`. Its constructor receives an height. Its `test` method returns `true` iff the person is greater than the height given when building it. Test it similarly in a unit test. Similarly, make sure your test includes a line such as `Predicate<Person> myPredicate = …`.
** Replace in your first unit test the right hand side of `Predicate<Person> myPredicate = …` by a lambda expression: do not use your `IsNameAToG` class any more. You should now be able to delete your class, and the unit test should still pass.
** Proceed similarly for the second unit test.

*Graded homework*: string-files-homework. Your last commit before the end of the 10th of May will be graded again, using the same set of tests as the graded test. This will count for 70% of a normal test. The string-files graded test counts for 30% or a normal test. Please commit on the same repository as the one already used (string-files).

* Graded test: score-keeper. About referring to objects from other objects. You will have 60 minutes (push before 9:35). There will be several interfaces, you only have to implement `MyScoreManager`. (You may need to implement other classes to achieve this.) There is no documentation in this project: you will have to read the unit tests to understand what the class is supposed to do.
