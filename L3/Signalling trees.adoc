= Signalling trees

Accept https://classroom.github.com/a/inxYz2iq[this assignment].
You must implement all documented contracts.
Hint: you do not have to implement `Iterable` or `Iterator` for this exercice, try to rather use structures that you know.
You may use all the dependencies contained in the POM but you may not add dependencies.
This exercice is (very loosely) inspired by https://doi.org/10.1111/pce.13966[this article] (you do not have to read the article).

When the instructions donâ€™t specify some behavior exactly, you can choose your own approach - as long as you still meet all the stated requirements. 
I will not provide supplementary explanations unless there is a mistake in the wording.

Here is a suggestion for ordering your work.

- Implement `Signal`
- Implement `Forester`
- Implement `TreeTests` (one is provided for you)
- Implement the easy methods among `Tree` and `ComplexTree` (do not forget `equals` and the like)
- Implement `Forest` methods that return instances of other classes (most important as this is required to test your other classes), such as `plantTree` and `forester`
- Implement the remaining methods of `Tree`, `ComplexTree`, `Forest`
-- Implement `transitiveSignals` last, as it is more difficult

Here is an indicative decomposition. Points will be awarded only for the instances that can be created through the documented methods.

- `Signal`: 1.5 points
- `Forester`: 1.5 points
- `TreeTests`: 5 points
- `Tree` and `ComplexTree`, except `transitiveSignals`: 7 points
- `Forest`: 3 points
- `transitiveSignals`: 2 points (1.5/2 if it works only on DAGs)
