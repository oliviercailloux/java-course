= Log

Logging is tracing what your program is doing with statements that indicate which instructions have been executed and the values of important variables.

This document shortly presents https://www.slf4j.org/[SLF4J] and https://logback.qos.ch/[logback], an API and an implementation to log in Java. It is not the only possible choice, but it is my favorite one, and probably the approach adopted by a https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/blob/master/Log/Usage.adoc[majority of developers], as far as I can judge.

See this https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/raw/main/Log/SLF4J/presentation.pdf[presentation] about SLF4J.

== Reason for logging frameworks
It is classical to use `System.out.println` to log.

However, this is not the cleanest way to log:

* it is not configurable
* it does not offer differentiated log levels
* if you later move the code to a standalone library or application, you will have to refactor all those statements to turn them into proper log statements

== SLF4J and Logback

To log using SLF4J, your project has to depend on the SLF4J https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.slf4j%20AND%20a:slf4j-api&core=gav[API] (see this example https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-archetype/blob/master/src/main/resources/archetype-resources/pom.xml[pom]).

To log, proceed as follows. First, declare a logger in your class `MyClassName` using this code.

----
@SuppressWarnings("unused")
private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyClassName.class);
----

(The suppress warnings is there to make sure the compiler will not nag you if it turns out you do not use the logger anywhere.)

You can then write logging statements such as `LOGGER.info("Hello, {}.", name);`, where `name` is a variable whose content you want to log. (See this example https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-archetype/blob/master/src/main/resources/archetype-resources/src/main/java/App.java[code].)

To effectively log using logback, https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:ch.qos.logback%20AND%20a:logback-classic&core=gav[depend] on it and add a `logback.xml` configuration file in your class path (https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-archetype/blob/master/src/main/resources/archetype-resources/src/main/resources/logback.xml[example]).

https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-archetype[This] Maven archetype lets you quickly start a project already configured for SLF4J and logback.
