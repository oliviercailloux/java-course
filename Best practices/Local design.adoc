= Local design

Various tips for good code from the local structure point of view (as opposed to architectural design questions), that do not fit in the other categories on this site.

== Avoid numerous parameters
Avoid method with numerous parameters, especially if they are of the same type. It increases the risk of passing a parameter for another one. For example, avoid `buildPerson(firstName: String, lastName: String, description: String, phoneNumber: String, address: String)` (use a https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/127509[builder] instead).

== Choose your return and field types wisely
When a method returns a narrow type rather than a more general one (for example, `ImmutableList` instead of `List`, or `List` instead of `Iterable`), it makes it possibly more useful for the user, because a more specific returned type may offer more services or more guarantees. For example, `ImmutableList` makes it clear that the list will never be modified; `List` permits to access an element https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html#get(int)[by index] or to ask for the https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html#size()[size] of the collection, which you can’t do with a simple `Iterable`. 

On the other hand, returning a narrow type ties your implementation more strongly, as it better specifies the service that your method offers. For example, if you declare you return a `Collection` rather than a `List`, you can choose to rather return a `Set` later instead of a list.

Sometimes, the best choice will depend on the specific details of your method or on its intended usage. But some choices may be usually bad: if a type is more specific but does not offer much more capabilities, it is a bad choice. For example, there is usually no reason to return `ArrayList` rather than `List`. And it very often makes conceptual sense to choose once and for all to return a `List` (because duplicates are possible or access by index makes sense), or choose once and for all to return a `Set` (because duplicates should be merged and access by index is unimportant): if one of those possibilities is conceptually justified but the other one is not, it is probably unwise to return a simple `Iterable` instead of a more capable type.

This also applies to the types of the fields in classes.

== Accept general parameters if not costly
Consider whether it is advantageous to design your method so that it accepts more general parameters. For example, instead of accepting a `Set`, can you make it accept a `Collection`? Or an `Iterable`? 

There are usually pro and cons with making a method more general: it makes the method more likely to be useful or easier to use; but it may render implementation more difficult, or it may be more difficult to understand what the method does. Thus, the best answer may be subjective or may subtly depend on the case at hand, but some choices may still be better than others.

For example, a method that takes a `Set` as parameter and prints its content to the screen should rather accept an `Iterable` as parameter: this has no drawback and thus makes the method more general “for free”: now the method can be called also with a `List`, for example.

But, as another example, consider a method that takes a `Set` as parameter but that does something that makes sense only if the input collection contains no duplicates. In such a case, the fact that the parameter is a `Set` helps the user understand the method. It may be quite unclear what the method would do if the input was a list (you would perhaps need to document that, for example, duplicates will be eliminated).

Some choices are almost invariably bad, though. For example, I have never seen a valid reason to accept an `ImmutableSet` instead of a `Set` as a parameter: such a type is more constrained, thus makes the method less general, but it hardly makes anything clearer and does not ease implementation.

== Factor
In algebra, you factor an expression such as `ax+bx+cx` by transforming it into `x(a+b+c)`. View this as a way of not repeating yourself: we say only once to multiply by `x`. Similarly, you can often factor your code. When two methods have some code in common, and only differ by a small portion, there is certainly a way of putting what is common to both methods in a method, and let both methods call this one method, or re-use the code in some other way. You thereby make your code more concise (thus easier to understand and verify) and make sure that there is only one place to change if you spot a bug.

== The `#toString()` method
Consider overriding `#toString()` on your model classes, and use the Guava https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/CommonObjectUtilitiesExplained#tostring[helper] to implement it. Favor the form `MoreObjects.toStringHelper(this)`.

== Warnings
Your production-ready code should exhibit no warning. In a good quality code, meeting any warning should trigger an urge to solve the problem before going further. 

In *rare* cases, the IDE will produce a warning that you can be sure does not apply to your situation. _Even in that case_, you should take care of the warning and not leave it unattended. Otherwise, the reader of your code will not easily see which warnings it should take seriously, and this prevents applying the systematic strategy of taking warnings seriously. There is certainly a way of making such a spurious warning disappear. Using `@SuppressWarnings` can be considered in such a case, but should be considered a last resort solution, and applied only if you are absolutely confident that the IDE is wrong, not you (hint: usually the opposite is true).

== Favor for each syntax
Favor the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/for.html[for each] syntax for looping over an `Iterable` type. It is shorter and clearer than an explicit use of an iterator or of an array index.
