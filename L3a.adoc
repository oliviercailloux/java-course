The entry page of the Java course in L3.

== Prerequisites
You know algorithmics and, preferrably, the basic syntax of Java (or a related language). If you have followed an algorithmics course with illustrations and exercices in Java, you satisfy the prerequisites.

== Abbreviations

* [I]: Important
* [O]: Optional (do it if you are specifically interested in the related aspect)
* ESx.y (or ESx.y.z): designates section x.y (or x.y.z) in Eck’s http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/[book] (in chapter x)
* EQx: quiz chapter x
* EQx.y: question number y in Eck’s book, from quiz chapter x
* EEx.y: exercice number y in Eck’s book, from exercices chapter x
* Ranges are always given with ends included (EQ1.3 to 1.9 means 3 and 9 included)
* Markers apply to the whole line. Example: "4.3 intro to 4.3.2, 4.6.1 [I]" means that everything in between 4.3 and 4.3.2 plus 4.6.1 are important.

== General references
* Eck’s http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/[book]
* Stéphane Airiau’s https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~airiau/Teaching/L3-Java/[course] (in French)

*Lecture*

* https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/raw/master/Pr%C3%A9sentation%20du%20cours%20Objet/presentation.pdf[Pres course]
* https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/raw/master/Syntaxe/presentation.pdf[Syntax] (without classes and objects) [Should be known or easy]
* Exercice with https://docs.oracle.com/java/javase/13/jshell/[jshell]:
** Assign 4659 and 23 to variables, and show the result of multiplying these variables
** Show the greatest divisor of 4659 that is different than 4659 (use the `%` operator and a loop)
** Define a method that accepts an integer parameter and returns its greatest divisor except itself; use it to show the greatest divisor of 4659.
** Going beyond: https://arbitrary-but-fixed.net/teaching/java/jshell/2017/12/14/jshell-peculiarities.html[The peculiarities of the JShell]
* Syntax (end): classes (no objects)
** Material: http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/contents-with-subsections.html[ES1.4] (Building blocks of programs), 2 intro (names and things), 2.1 (basic Java application), 2.2 (variables and primitive types), 2.3.3 (operations on strings), 2.4.1 (basic and formatted output), 2.5 (expressions), 2.6.7 (packages), ES3 intro to 3.6 (blocks, loops, algorithmic development, switch) [Should be known or easy]
** http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c2/[ES2.2.1] (variables), 2.3.1 (subroutines), 2.4.6 (scanner for input) [I]
** ES1.6 (modern UI), 1.7 (internet) [O]
* With a text editor: define a class `MyMathClass` containing the method above and a method that returns the smallest divisor (greater than one) of its parameter; and a class `MyBooleanClass` containing a method `xor` returning `true` iff exactly one of its parameter is `true`. Copy-paste this in jshell and make sure you can call all these methods from jshell.
* https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/raw/master/Ex%C3%A9cution/presentation.pdf[Exécution]
** http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/contents-with-subsections.html[ES1.1] (machine language), 1.2 (Asynchronous events), 1.3 (JVM)
* Exercices:
** Add a `main` method to your `MyBooleanClass` that prints “Hello, this is my boolean class.” Use `System.out.println("…")` to print.
** Add a `main` method to you `MyMathClass` that calls your `xor` method with `true` and `false` and prints the result, followed by the first argument given to the program.
** Compile `MyBooleanClass` with https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/specs/man/javac.html[javac], move the resulting file into its own folder, execute it from the source folder.
** Find out _in the official documentation_ how to compile the class and let the resulting class be placed in its own folder, in a single step (without you having to move the file afterwards)
** Compile `MyMathClass`, move the resulting file into its own folder (alone), and execute it from the source folder. Why does it fail? What does the error message indicate, and how is it related to the problem? Fix the problem and execute it, first by grouping the class files, second, while keeping both class files in different folders.
** (link:http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/c2/exercises.html[EE2.1] to 2.2, supposedly known)

=== S5 (Thursday 4th of April, 2019)

*Lecture*

* Graded quizz
** Search path = class path (approximation)
** “Does not compile” ⇒ only if conceptual problem (for example, a variable is out of scope or a class is used instead of an object)
** Linux syntax, thus `/` and `:` (Windows uses `\` and `;`). Paths may be terminated by `/`, arguments may be surrounded by quotes.
** Questions and answers in randomized order. It is possible that no answer is correct.
** Read with care
** Late ⇒ zero

* https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/blob/master/JUnit.adoc[Unit testing]
* Inheritance: Object; print an object; more polymorphism.
* Generics and https://www.scientecheasy.com/2018/09/collection-hierarchy-in-java.html[collections].
** For this course, use by default: `ArrayList`; `LinkedHashSet`; `LinkedHashMap`.

*Material and going beyond*

* http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c5/[ES5.5] to 5.8
* http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c10/[ES10] to 10.2
// simple inheritance (no TextIO depended on, actually), but complex set up
* http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c5/exercises.html[EE5.4] (use `Scanner` instead of `TextIO`)
//interfaces with generics and collections

// set (long)
* http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/javanotes7/c10/exercises.html[EE10.2]

*Exercices*

* Write an interface `Calculator` with a method `add` that takes two integers as parameters. Write a method `tester` in a different class that receives a calculator as a parameter and check that `add(2, 3)` gives 5. Write a `SimpleCalculator` that uses the normal Java addition (“+”) to implement `Calculator`.
//interfaces with generics
* Implement a `Predicate<String>` to represent a function that associates to a String the value `true` iff its length is even.
* Define a class `Pair<T1, T2>` to store an ordered pair of objects of type `T1` and `T2`.
// implements but no inheritance
* http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c5/exercises.html[EE5.7] [I] (the part about anonymous classes is optional)
//** Supplementary requirements: your code must lie in at least two packages;
//** The idea of this exercice is that you simulate that three different people work on this exercice: one provides some interfaces; another implements the interfaces; a third one uses the interfaces and their implementations to solve the exercice (except you represent all these persons).
//** Declare at least one interface in another Eclipse project, exported as a Java archive (JAR file);
//** implement those interfaces in another Eclipse project, exported as a Java archive (JAR file) (will you need the previous JAR file? Why / why not?);
//** solve the exercices in a third Eclipse project (will you need the previous JAR files? Which ones and why?).
// read, sort a list
* http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c7/exercises.html[EE7.1], 7.5 (except that you can use built-sorting functions from the Java API).
* A class E1 that asks the end-user for a set of integer values. The user enters 0 to stop entering values. Store these values in a Set of Integer values (discarding duplicates). Do it again, obtaining a second set. Then print each set of values entered, then the union of both sets. For example, if the user enters 3, 4, 2, 0, then 1, 1, 2, 5, 0, it prints: 3, 4, 2, then 1, 2, 5, then 3, 4, 2, 1, 5. Use Java sets and interfaces appropriately. [I]

* No plagiarism (but reuse!)
* Static factory method
** A static method
** Produces the type of the class it belongs to
** Serves as a factory
** Examples: `String.valueOf(true);`, `Integer.valueOf(3);`, `ImmutableList.of();`, `String.link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#format(java.lang.String,java.lang.Object...)[format]("Person name: %s, id: %d", name, id);`

* Files and https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/blob/master/Flows.adoc[flows]
* https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/blob/master/Best%20practices/Resources.adoc[Resources]; exercice: read a file from the class path.
* Primitive types (autoboxing); optional; give guarantees: https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/blob/master/Best%20practices/Null.adoc[Best practices]

*Exercices*

* Implement an interface `EasyMap` with two methods: a method that puts a pair of key and value of your choice into a map, and a method that returns an `Optional` containing the value corresponding to the given key (parameter of the method) or that returns an empty `Optional` if there is no such value. Implement this interface in a class `EasyMapImpl`. Provide a static factory method in the interface `EasyMap`. Minimize the number of lines of code (but not at the price of readability). Note that this exercice implements the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forwarding_(object-oriented_programming)[forwarding] pattern.
** Define `MyComparator`, a class that implements a comparator over your values. Add a third method to `EasyMap`, that returns a list of values ordered by that comparator.
// list of words
* http://math.hws.edu/javanotes8/c7/exercises.html[EE7.6] (do not use the provided method: split words at space character; use standard file IO instead of TextIO)
