= Maven
:sectanchors:

Simple exercices for Maven. The reader is supposed to know already the basics of Maven (see slides in this course).

// * Add a dependency to the latest version of the https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/[`jgit`] library (which permits to programmatically access the content of a git repository) that is in Maven Central. You have to find the right Maven coordinates. Commit into your branch (so that your commit has the starting commit as parent).

== Default sample project
In this exercice we will use an archetype called `maven-archetype-quickstart`, that allows us to generate a basic project.

* Open a terminal. Move into a directory into which you want to put your new project (which will be created as a sub-directory).
* Type `mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-archetype-plugin:3.1.2:generate`. 

The command `mvn` followed by “groupId:pluginId:version:goal” runs Maven with the given goal, defined in the given plugin.
Thus, this command simply executes the goal `generate` in the Maven plugin with id https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.apache.maven.plugins/maven-archetype-plugin[`maven-archetype-plugin`] published under the groupId `org.apache.maven.plugins`.

The command displays a long list of archetypes available to you. Then you see something like “Choose a number or apply filter (format: [groupId:]artifactId, case sensitive contains): 1388:”. (You will see a different number.)

* You are supposed to either provide a number; provide a filter; or accept the default answer.
* The default answer, if any, is always given just before the last colon, in this example it is 1388.
* In this exercice, we will rather use the filter to make sure we select the plugin we want. To use a filter, just enter (a part or the whole of) the artifactId of the desired archetype. Then a “case senstive contains” search is run, meaning simply that Maven will list all the archetypes whose artifactId contains the string you entered.

We’ll start by using the archetype having groupId and artifactId `org.apache.maven.archetypes:maven-archetype-quickstart`.

* Find this one by using the filter in the command line, then select it using its number.
* Consider the next question. What is the default answer? We want to accept the default, so we just press ENTER.
* Answer the remaining questions, either by accepting the default answers when they seem reasonable, or by providing your own answers.

Your project gets created in a sub-directory of your current position.

* Which files has Maven created? What are their purpose?
* In the terminal, move into the newly created project.
* Type `mvn compile`. What does it do, and why (how does it work)? Is `compile` a phase, or a plugin goal (http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html#Lifecycle_Reference[answer])?
* What has changed in your project directory?
* Run the compiled application from the shell (go into the `target/classes` directory and use the _full name_ of the class you want to run). What does it do?

== Modern project
Let’s now use a different archetype to generate a project better suited for our future use.

* Move into the directory of your choice to prepare for the new project creation.
* Use the appopriate command to trigger the archetype `generate` goal again.
* This time, use the `io.github.oliviercailloux:java-archetype` archetype.
* Answer the required questions.

Your project gets created in a sub-directory of your current position.

* What changed, compared to the previous project? Compare in particular both `pom.xml` files: what changed? What will be the effect of those changes?
* Compare your answer to the https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-archetype[documentation].

Finally, import your project in your IDE.
