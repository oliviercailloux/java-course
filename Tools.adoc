Various useful tools for Java and Java EE developers.

== Java

* https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java] 9 (or ulterior)
** Important advice. Uninstall every version of Java you have, keep only one: the latest JDK (which includes a JRE). This prevents problems with tools selecting the wrong JDK or JRE.
** On Debian: https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=openjdk-11-jdk&searchon=names&exact=1&suite=all&section=all[openjdk-11-jdk] (install https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=openjdk-11-source&searchon=names&exact=1&suite=all&section=all[openjdk-11-source] to have the Javadoc accessible even when coding offline).
** On Windows: install the JDK (which itself comes with a private JRE). Do not install the public JRE (uncheck the box). Set the environment variables: JAVA_HOME to where you installed the JDK and https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-microsoft-windows-platforms.html#GUID-96EB3876-8C7A-4A25-9F3A-A2983FEC016A[PATH] to "%JAVA_HOME%\bin" (for details, see http://maven.apache.org/install.html[Maven] and http://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_How_do_I_run_Eclipse%3F#Find_the_JVM[Eclipse].
//** Note: some https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml[doc] indicates that setting the PATH is not necessary to run Java programs. However, http://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_How_do_I_run_Eclipse%3F#Find_the_JVM[Eclipse] (for example) will apparently not start if it does not find Java in the path (unless specifically configured). Perhaps the https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/shell/app-registration[App Paths] mechanism could be used instead? (See also https://parsiya.net/blog/2017-10-23-run-line-vs.-cmd-vs.-powershell/[here].) Setting JAVA_HOME might be unnecessary, as under Linux (link not valid any more: sources.debian.org/src/openjdk-8/8u181-b13-1/debian/JAVA_HOME/). TODO: check whether .jar start; check whether Maven requires JAVA_HOME.
* https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8826881/maven-install-on-mac-os-x[this] might be useful for Mac OS; I didn’t test it)

For Java SE, add:

* https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/[Eclipse IDE] “for Java Developers”

For Java EE, add:

* https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/[Eclipse IDE] “for Java EE Developers”
* Download and install (deflate) https://wildfly.org/downloads/[WildFly] (14.0.1.Final or more recent, Java EE Full & Web Distribution)
* https://tools.jboss.org/downloads/jbosstools/2018-09/4.9.0.Final.html[JBoss Tools], a plug-in for easy deployment to Wildfly. Install only JBoss AS, WildFly & EAP Server Tools. (Rationale: I have had stability issues in Eclipse after installing the whole of JBoss Tools.) Or https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/blob/master/Automated%20Eclipse%20install.adoc[automate] it.

== Git

* Git https://git-scm.com/downloads[client] (I recommend the command line for learning; I’ve been told https://www.gitkraken.com/[GitKraken] is a great GUI complement)
* https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup[Configure] your git identity: `user.name` and `user.email`. (Specific for GitHub: https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-your-username-in-git[user.name], https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-your-commit-email-address[user.email].)

== Command line
You should know how to execute command-line operations (thus, how to open a “terminal”). In Windows, use https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-windows-powershell[PowerShell].

== Eclipse
For Eclipse users, I strongly recommend reading the following, for a great increase to your productivity and pleasure of coding.

* Workbench User Guide, http://help.eclipse.org/2019-03/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/gettingStarted/qs-02a.htm?cp=0_1_0_0[Basic tutorial]
* Workbench User Guide, http://help.eclipse.org/2019-03/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tips/platform_tips.html?cp=0_5[Tips and Tricks]
* Java development user guide, http://help.eclipse.org/2019-03/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/gettingStarted/qs-2.htm[Basic tutorial]
* Java development user guide, http://help.eclipse.org/2019-03/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tips/jdt_tips.html?cp=1_5[Tips and Tricks] (JDT) (bit by bit!)

[[Eclipse-strict]]
=== Configuration
I recommend configuring Eclipse to show more errors and warnings in order to help spot mistakes and code smells early.

* From Eclipse, import my sample https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/blob/master/Best%20practices/Eclipse-prefs.epf[epf] (Eclipse preference) file. 
* You can read the file contents to see what this changes to your Eclipse configuration.
* Check in `Windows / Preferences` whether the changes were applied. For example, check in `Java / Code Style / Code Templates` that the `Catch block body` contains `throw new IllegalStateException(e);`.
* Check in your project properties, `Java Compiler / Errors/Warnings` that the project uses your global Eclipse compiler settings.
* Clean and recompile your project to see the effect.

== VM (beta)
https://universitedauphine-my.sharepoint.com/personal/olivier_cailloux_lamsade_dauphine_fr/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?docid=03887190377294e79a8a63c8f063ffe9b&authkey=AdV4WjBgnfjLa2IRffbav5s&e=10400376c63043138b324257b2c8c6a6[Here] is a Virtual Machine (VM) file that contains (almost) all the tools above. It features https://www.debian.org/doc/user-manuals[Debian] stretch (9.2), a GNU/Linux system. The VM file is in a standard format (OVA). You can import it in https://www.virtualbox.org/[Virtual Box] for example. Tell me if you are interested, I will then update it.

The file is in beta version, please report any issues https://github.com/oliviercailloux/Deb-9-VM[here].

Note that you will get (much?) better performance by installing the tools directly on your machine rather than using them through a VM.
