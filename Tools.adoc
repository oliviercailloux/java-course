Various useful tools for Java (EE) developers.

== Java SE

* Eclipse https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/neon2[Neon] Java
* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java] 8
** Important advice. Uninstall every version of Java you have, keep only one: the latest JDK (not a JRE).

== Java EE

* Eclipse https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/neon2[Neon] Java EE
* `GlassFish Tools for Eclipse` plug-in: from Eclipse, Help / Eclipse Marketplaceâ€¦
* https://glassfish.java.net/download.html[Glassfish] 4.1.1 (Java EE 7 Full Platform)
* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java] 8
** Important advice. Uninstall every version of Java you have, keep only one: the latest JDK (not a JRE).

== Git

* Git https://git-scm.com/downloads[client]
** Optional: https://git-for-windows.github.io/[Git for Windows]; https://tortoisegit.org/[TortoiseGit].
** https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup[Configure] your git identity: user.name and user.email. (Specific for GitHub: https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-username-in-git/[user.name], https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/[user.email].)

== Eclipse
For Eclipse users, I strongly recommend reading the following. It does take some time, but will pay off as it will greatly increase your productivity and pleasure of coding.

* Eclipse Workbench User Guide, http://help.eclipse.org/neon/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/gettingStarted/qs-02a.htm?cp=0_1_0_0[Basic tutorial]
* Workbench User Guide, http://help.eclipse.org/neon/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tips/platform_tips.html?cp=0_5[Tips and Tricks]
* Java development user guide, http://help.eclipse.org/neon/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/gettingStarted/qs-2.htm[Basic tutorial]
* Java development user guide, http://help.eclipse.org/neon/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tips/jdt_tips.html?cp=1_5[Tips and Tricks] (JDT) (bit by bit!)

=== Configuration
I recommend configuring Eclipse to show more errors and warnings in order to help spot mistakes and code smells early.

* From Eclipse, import my sample link:++Best practices/Eclipse-prefs.epf++[epf] (Eclipse preference) file. 
* You can read the file contents to see what this changes to your Eclipse configuration.
* Check in `Windows / Preferences` whether the changes were applied. For example, check in `Java / Code Style / Code Templates` that the `Catch block body` contains `throw new IllegalStateException(e);`.
* Make sure your Java compiler configuration of your project is set to reflect the one from the global workspace.
* Clean and recompile your projects to see the effect.
